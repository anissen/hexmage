Tasks:

  ✔ Make AIPlayer return multiple actions for per turn @done (26-01-15 22:46)
  ✔ Hardcode max moves, attacks per turn @done (27-01-15 20:28)
  ☐ Use RuleEngine to filter available actions (e.g. a rule for units can only move once, attack once per turn)
  ☐ Use minimax algorithm to return the hierarchically best actions


Minimax fix:


    minimax algorithm:
        take_turn algorithm: 
            find best/worst actions for turn
            perform actions
            end turn
